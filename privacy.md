How we use it
- To contact you about trips and updates.

Lawful basis & consent

- We rely on explicit consent to add you to our waiting list. The form includes a required consent checkbox. We record the timestamp of form submission to document consent.

Data processors

International transfers

- Submission data may be processed or stored outside the European Economic Area. Where necessary we rely on standard contractual clauses, processor safeguards, or other lawful transfer mechanisms.

Retention

- We keep waiting list data until you ask us to remove it, or until it is no longer needed for the purpose you signed up for.
